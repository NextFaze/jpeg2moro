TODO: extend APP10 segment to allow abitrary data chunks? (ALPH chunk for alpha data?)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

We use the APP10 marker segment (0xFFE9) to store alpha channel information about a JPEG image.

The APP10 segment should appear just before the SOS (start of scan) segment in the JFIF headers.

The alpha channel may be represented as 1 bit, 8 bit, or 16 bit values (16 bit data should be stored in network byte order).

An alpha value of zero represents full transparency, and a value of 2^(bitdepth)-1 represents a fully opaque pixel. Intermediate values indicate partially transparent pixels that can be combined with a background image to yield a composite image.

The segment contains a single byte representing the bit depth of the alpha channel (0x01, 0x08 or 0x10), followed by the alpha channel data compressed using the DEFLATE algorithm.

The full marker segment is (bytes)

[0xFF, 0xE9, length MSB, length LSB, bit depth, compressed data...]

where length is an unsigned short (2 bytes) in network byte order, representing the number of bytes in the data segment.
length includes the length of the compressed alpha data, itself, and the bit depth byte.
length is therefore equal to length(compressed data) + 3.
